# BubblePhysics-Education

BubblePhysics-Education is a feature in the sandbox-game [BubblePhysics](https://zenonet.itch.io/bubblephysics) which allows you to control the player autonomously using a TCP-Connection.

To make it easier, you can use a Python-Library that automatically connects to the TCP-Server and allows for easy control over the game.
