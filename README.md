# BubblePhysics-Education

BubblePhysics-Education is a feature in the sandbox-game [BubblePhysics](https://zenonet.itch.io/bubblephysics) which allows you to control the player autonomously using a TCP-Connection.

## Installation

The TCP-Functionality is built into BubblePhysics itself so you just need to download/install BubblePhysics from [itch.io](https://zenonet.itch.io/bubblephysics/download/oyaAxQJGwXlQ__hdlvmyrp7lCZ6xlvOxQGmtpaO2)<br>
Note that you need to use a desktop build because in most browsers, websites aren't able to create TCP-Servers.

## Python Library

To make it easier, you can use a Python-Library that automatically connects to the TCP-Server and allows for easy control over the game.
The library is a single python file, which you can find [here](https://github.com/zenonet/BubblePhysics-Education/blob/main/BubblePhysics.py).
